      "Summary: In this paper we offer a formal definition of Artificial Intelligence and this directly gives us an algorithm for construction of this object. Really, this algorithm is useless due to the combinatory explosion. The main innovation in our definition is that it does not include the knowledge as a part of the intelligence. So according to our definition a newly born baby also is an Intellect. Here we differs with Turing's definition which suggests that an Intellect is a person with knowledge gained through the years.\n",

Analyzing the current development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the proposal is that AI should be clearly divided into the following categories: Artificial Human Intelligence (AHI), Artificial Machine Intelligence (AMI), and Artificial Biological Intelligence (ABI), which will also be the main directions of theory and application development for AI. As a watershed for the branches of AI, some classification standards and methods are discussed: 1) Human-oriented, machine-oriented, and biological-oriented AI R&D; 2) Information input processed by Dimensionality-up or Dimensionality-reduction; 3) The use of one/few or large samples for knowledge learning.\n",

      "Question: What is the research focus of the paper titled 'Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs: A survey'?\n",
      "Answer: Artificial Intelligence applications gradually move outside the safe walls of research labs and invade our daily lives. This is also true for Machine Learning methods on Knowledge Graphs, which has led to a steady increase in their application since the beginning of the 21st century. However, in many applications, users require an explanation of the Artificial Intelligences decision. This led to increased demand for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence. Knowledge Graphs epitomize fertile soil for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, due to their ability to display connected data, i.e. knowledge, in a human- as well as machine-readable way. This survey gives a short history to Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. Furthermore, we contribute by arguing that the concept Explainable Artificial Intelligence is overloaded and overlapping with Interpretable Machine Learning. By introducing the parent concept Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, we provide a clear-cut distinction of both concepts while accounting for their similarities. Thus, we provide in this survey a case for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs consisting of Interpretable Machine Learning on Knowledge Graphs and Explainable Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. This leads to the introduction of a novel taxonomy for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. In addition, a comprehensive overview of the research on Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs is presented and put into the context of the taxonomy. Finally, research gaps in the field of Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs are identified for future research.\n",

      "Answer: Thanks to rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in recent years, the current artificial intelligence technology is contributing to many part of society. Education, environment, medical care, military, tourism, economy, politics, etc. are having a very large impact on society as a whole. For example, in the field of education, there is an artificial intelligence tutoring system that automatically assigns tutors based on student's level. In the field of economics, there are quantitative investment methods that automatically analyze large amounts of data to find investment laws to create investment models or predict changes in financial markets. As such, artificial intelligence technology is being used in various fields. So, it is very important to know exactly what factors have an important influence on each field of artificial intelligence technology and how the relationship between each field is connected. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze artificial intelligence technology in each field. In this paper, we analyze patent documents related to artificial intelligence technology. We propose a method for keyword analysis within factors using artificial intelligence patent data sets for artificial intelligence technology analysis. This is a model that relies on feature engineering based on deep learning model named KeyBERT, and using vector space model. A case study of collecting and analyzing artificial intelligence patent data was conducted to show how the proposed model can be applied to real world problems.\n",

Both need to find a quantitative method to evaluate the intelligence level of intelligence systems, including human intelligence. Based on the standard intelligence system and the extended Von Neumann architecture, this paper proposes General IQ, Service IQ and Value IQ evaluation methods for intelligence systems, depending on different evaluation purposes. Among them, the General IQ of intelligence systems is to answer the question of whether the artificial intelligence can surpass the human intelligence, which is reflected in putting the intelligence systems on an equal status and conducting the unified evaluation. The Service IQ and Value IQ of intelligence systems are used to answer the question of how the intelligent products can better serve the human, reflecting the intelligence and required cost of each intelligence system as a product in the process of serving human.\n",

The current issue with artificial intelligence is a lack of transparency into its decision making, and literature shows that increasing transparency increases trust. Explainable artificial intelligence has the ability to increase transparency of AI, which could potentially increase trust for humans. This paper attempts to use the task of predicting yelp review star ratings with assistance from an explainable and non explainable artificial intelligence to see if trust is increased with increased transparency. Results show that for these tasks, explainable artificial intelligence provided significant increase in trust as a measure of influence.\n",

      "Answer: Artificial Intelligence is widely regarded as a transformative force with the potential to redefine numerous sectors of human civilization. While Artificial Intelligence has evolved from speculative fiction to a pivotal element of technological progress, its role as a truly transformative agent, or transformative Artificial Intelligence, remains a subject of debate. This work explores the historical precedents of technological breakthroughs, examining whether Artificial Intelligence can achieve a comparable impact, and it delves into various ethical frameworks that shape the perception and development of Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, it considers the societal, technical, and regulatory challenges that must be addressed for Artificial Intelligence to become a catalyst for global change. We also examine not only the strategies and methodologies that could lead to transformative Artificial Intelligence but also the barriers that could ultimately make these goals unattainable. We end with a critical inquiry into whether reaching a transformative Artificial Intelligence might compel humanity to adopt an entirely new ethical approach, tailored to the complexities of advanced Artificial Intelligence. By addressing the ethical, social, and scientific dimensions of Artificial Intelligence's development, this work contributes to the broader discourse on the long-term implications of Artificial Intelligence and its capacity to drive civilization toward a new era of progress or, conversely, exacerbate existing inequalities and risks.\n",

Numerous open-source games or game-based environments have been implemented for studying artificial intelligence. In addition to single- or multi-player, collaborative or adversarial games, there has also been growing interest in implementing platforms for creative design in recent years. Those platforms provide ideal benchmarks for exploring and comparing artificial intelligence ideas and techniques.

      "Answer: Currently, potential threats of artificial intelligence (AI) to human have triggered a large controversy in society, behind which, the nature of the issue is whether the artificial intelligence (AI) system can be evaluated quantitatively. This article analyzes and evaluates the challenges that the AI development level is facing, and proposes that the evaluation methods for the human intelligence test and the AI system are not uniform; and the key reason for which is that none of the models can uniformly describe the AI system and the beings like human. Aiming at this problem, a standard intelligent system model is established in this study to describe the AI system and the beings like human uniformly. Based on the model, the article makes an abstract mathematical description, and builds the standard intelligent machine mathematical model; expands the Von Neumann architecture and proposes the Liufeng - Shiyong architecture; gives the definition of the artificial intelligence IQ, and establishes the artificial intelligence scale and the evaluation method; conduct the test on 50 search engines and three human subjects at different ages across the world, and finally obtains the ranking of the absolute IQ and deviation IQ ranking for artificial intelligence IQ 2014.\n",

      "Answer: Recent advances in the development of artificial intelligence, technological progress acceleration, long-term trends of macroeconomic dynamics increase the relevance of technological singularity hypothesis. In this paper, we build a model of finite-time technological singularity assuming that artificial intelligence will replace humans for artificial intelligence engineers after some point in time when it is developed enough. This model implies the following: let A be the level of development of artificial intelligence. Then, the moment of technological singularity n is defined as the point in time where artificial intelligence development function approaches infinity. Thus, it happens in finite time. Although infinite level of development of artificial intelligence cannot be reached practically, this approximation is useful for several reasons, firstly because it allows modeling a phase transition or a change of regime. In the model, intelligence growth function appears to be hyperbolic function under relatively broad conditions which we list and compare. Subsequently, we also add a stochastic term (Brownian motion) to the model and investigate the changes in its behavior. The results can be applied for the modeling of dynamics of various processes characterized by multiplicative growth.\n",

      "Question: What is the research focus of the paper titled 'Creativity and Artificial Intelligence: A Digital Art Perspective'?\n",
      "Answer: This paper describes the application of artificial intelligence to the creation of digital art. AI is a computational paradigm that codifies intelligence into machines. There are generally three types of artificial intelligence and these are machine learning, evolutionary programming and soft computing. Machine learning is the statistical approach to building intelligent systems. Evolutionary programming is the use of natural evolutionary systems to design intelligent machines. Some of the evolutionary programming systems include genetic algorithm which is inspired by the principles of evolution and swarm optimization which is inspired by the swarming of birds, fish, ants etc. Soft computing includes techniques such as agent based modelling and fuzzy logic. Opportunities on the applications of these to digital art are explored.\n",

      "Answer: In 1998, Fields medalist Stephen Smale [S. Smale, Mathematical problems for the next century, The mathematical Intelligencer, 20(2) (1998), 7-15] proposed his famous eighteen problems to the mathematicians of this century. The statement of his eighteenth problem is very simple but very important. He asked \"What are the limits of intelligence, both artificial and human?\". In this paper, we prove that human intelligence is limitless. Moreover, we provide justifications to state that artificial intelligence has limitations. Thus, human intelligence will always remain superior to artificial intelligence. Moreover, we provide justifications to conclude the limitations of artificial intelligence.\n",

      "Question: What is the research focus of the paper titled 'Improving Global Weather and Ocean Wave Forecast with Large Artificial Intelligence Models'?\n",
      "Answer: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly in recent years, has led to the emergence of several large parameter artificial intelligence weather forecast models. These models represent a significant breakthrough, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical weather prediction models and indicating the emergence of profound potential tools for atmosphere-ocean forecasts. This study explores the evolution of these advanced artificial intelligence forecast models, and based on the identified commonalities, proposes the \"Three Large Rules\" to measure their development. We discuss the potential of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing numerical weather prediction, and briefly outlining the underlying reasons for its great potential. While acknowledging the high accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of deployment of large artificial intelligence forecast models, we also emphasize the irreplaceable values of traditional numerical forecasts and explore the challenges in the future development of large-scale artificial intelligence atmosphere-ocean forecast models. We believe that the optimal future of atmosphere-ocean weather forecast lies in achieving a seamless integration of artificial intelligence and traditional numerical models. Such a synthesis is anticipated to offer a more advanced and reliable approach for improved atmosphere-ocean forecasts. Additionally, we illustrate how forecasters can adapt and leverage the advanced artificial intelligence model through an example by building a large artificial intelligence model for global ocean wave forecast.\n",

      "Question: What is the research focus of the paper titled 'On a Functional Definition of Intelligence'?\n",
      "Answer: Without an agreed-upon definition of intelligence, asking \"is this system intelligent?\"\" is an untestable question. This lack of consensus hinders research, and public perception, on Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly since the rise of generative- and large-language models. Most work on precisely capturing what we mean by \"intelligence\" has come from the fields of philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science. Because these perspectives are intrinsically linked to intelligence as it is demonstrated by natural creatures, we argue such fields cannot, and will not, provide a sufficiently rigorous definition that can be applied to artificial means. Thus, we present an argument for a purely functional, black-box definition of intelligence, distinct from how that intelligence is actually achieved; focusing on the \"what\", rather than the \"how\". To achieve this, we first distinguish other related concepts (sentience, sensation, agency, etc.) from the notion of intelligence, particularly identifying how these concepts pertain to artificial intelligent systems. As a result, we achieve a formal definition of intelligence that is conceptually testable from only external observation, that suggests intelligence is a continuous variable. We conclude by identifying challenges that still remain towards quantifiable measurement. This work provides a useful perspective for both the development of AI, and for public perception of the capabilities and risks of AI.\n",

It is mathematically specified, extremely general, and captures the essence of many informal definitions of intelligence. It is based on Hutter's Universal Artificial Intelligence theory, an extension of Ray Solomonoff's pioneering work on universal induction. Since the Universal Intelligence Measure is only asymptotically computable, building a practical intelligence test from it is not straightforward.

      "Answer: The field of artificial intelligence has seen explosive growth and exponential success. The last phase of development showcased deep learnings ability to solve a variety of difficult problems across a multitude of domains. Many of these networks met and exceeded human benchmarks by becoming experts in the domains in which they are trained. Though the successes of artificial intelligence have begun to overshadow its failures, there is still much that separates current artificial intelligence tools from becoming the exceptional general learners that humans are. In this paper, we identify the ten commandments upon which human intelligence is systematically and hierarchically built. We believe these commandments work collectively to serve as the essential ingredients that lead to the emergence of higher-order cognition and intelligence. This paper discusses a computational framework that could house these ten commandments and suggests new architectural modifications that could lead to the development of smarter, more explainable, and generalizable artificial systems inspired by a neuromorphic approach.\n",

      "Answer: Artificial intelligence is known as the most effective technological field for rapid developments shaping the future of the world. Even today, it is possible to see intense use of intelligence systems in all fields of the life. Although advantages of the Artificial Intelligence are widely observed, there is also a dark side employing efforts to design hacking oriented techniques against Artificial Intelligence. Thanks to such techniques, it is possible to trick intelligent systems causing directed results for unsuccessful outputs. That is critical for also cyber wars of the future as it is predicted that the wars will be done unmanned, autonomous intelligent systems. Moving from the explanations, objective of this study is to provide information regarding adversarial examples threatening the Artificial Intelligence and focus on details of some techniques, which are used for creating adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are known as training data, which can trick a Machine Learning technique to learn incorrectly about the target problem and cause an unsuccessful or maliciously directed intelligent system at the end.

An important characteristic of several methodologies that reason with changes in belief or belief updates, is a property that we term modularity. We call updates that satisfy this property modular updates. Whereas probabilistic measures of belief update - which satisfy the modularity property were first discovered in the nineteenth century, knowledge and discussion of these quantities remains obscure in artificial intelligence research. We define modular updates and discuss their inappropriate use in two influential expert systems.\n",

      "Answer: The singularity refers to an idea that once a machine having an artificial intelligence surpassing the human intelligence capacity is created, it will trigger explosive technological and intelligence growth. I propose to test the hypothesis that machine intelligence capacity can grow autonomously starting with an intelligence comparable to that of bacteria - microbial intelligence. The goal will be to demonstrate that rapid growth in intelligence capacity can be realized at all in artificial computing systems. I propose the following three properties that may allow an artificial intelligence to exhibit a steady growth in its intelligence capacity: (i) learning with the ability to modify itself when exposed to more data, (ii) acquiring new functionalities (skills), and (iii) expanding or replicating itself. The algorithms must demonstrate a rapid growth in skills of dataprocessing and analysis and gain qualitatively different functionalities, at least until the current computing technology supports their scalable development. The existing algorithms that already encompass some of these or similar properties, as well as missing abilities that must yet be implemented, will be reviewed in this work. Future computational tests could support or oppose the hypothesis that artificial intelligence can potentially grow to the level of superintelligence which overcomes the limitations in hardware by producing necessary processing resources or by changing the physical realization of computation from using chip circuits to using quantum computing principles.\n",

      "Answer: Little by little, newspapers are revealing the bright future that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is building. Intelligent machines will help everywhere. However, this bright future has a dark side: a dramatic job market contraction before its unpredictable transformation. Hence, in a near future, large numbers of job seekers will need financial support while catching up with these novel unpredictable jobs. This possible job market crisis has an antidote inside. In fact, the rise of AI is sustained by the biggest knowledge theft of the recent years. Learning AI machines are extracting knowledge from unaware skilled or unskilled workers by analyzing their interactions. By passionately doing their jobs, these workers are digging their own graves. In this paper, we propose Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence (HIT-AI) as a fairer paradigm for Artificial Intelligence systems. HIT-AI will reward aware and unaware knowledge producers with a different scheme: decisions of AI systems generating revenues will repay the legitimate owners of the knowledge used for taking those decisions. As modern Robin Hoods, HIT-AI researchers should fight for a fairer Artificial Intelligence that gives back what it steals.\n",

However, for the effective defense against dynamically evolving attacks on networks, it is difficult to develop software with conventional fixed algorithms. This can be achieved by using artificial intelligence methods that provide flexibility and learning capability. The likelihood of developing cyber defense capabilities through increased intelligence of defense systems is quite high.

I argue that we can understand human intelligence, and the ways in which it may differ from artificial intelligence, by considering the characteristics of the kind of computational problems that human minds have to solve. I claim that these problems acquire their structure from three fundamental limitations that apply to human beings: limited time, limited computation, and limited communication. From these limitations we can derive many of the properties we associate with human intelligence, such as rapid learning, the ability to break down problems into parts, and the capacity for cumulative cultural evolution.\n",

To compare the potential intelligence exhibited by different cognitive systems, I use the common approach used by artificial intelligence and artificial life: Instead of studying the substrate of systems, let us focus on their organization. This organization can be measured with information. Thus, I apply an informationist epistemology to describe cognitive systems, including brains and computers. This allows me to frame the usefulness and limitations of the brain-computer analogy in different contexts. I also use this perspective to discuss the evolution and ecology of intelligence.\n",

      "Question: What is the research focus of the paper titled 'Measuring the intelligence of an idealized mechanical knowing agent'?\n",
      "Answer: We define a notion of the intelligence level of an idealized mechanical knowing agent. This is motivated by efforts within artificial intelligence research to define real-number intelligence levels of complicated intelligent systems. Our agents are more idealized, which allows us to define a much simpler measure of intelligence level for them. In short, we define the intelligence level of a mechanical knowing agent to be the supremum of the computable ordinals that have codes the agent knows to be codes of computable ordinals. We prove that if one agent knows certain things about another agent, then the former necessarily has a higher intelligence level than the latter. This allows our intelligence notion to serve as a stepping stone to obtain results which, by themselves, are not stated in terms of our intelligence notion (results of potential interest even to readers totally skeptical that our notion correctly captures intelligence). As an application, we argue that these results comprise evidence against the possibility of intelligence explosion (that is, the notion that sufficiently intelligent machines will eventually be capable of designing even more intelligent machines, which can then design even more intelligent machines, and so on).\n",

We explain how developmental and evolutionary theories of human cognition should further inform artificial intelligence. We emphasize the role of ecological niches in sculpting intelligent behavior, and in particular that human intelligence was fundamentally shaped to adapt to a constantly changing socio-cultural environment. We argue that a major limit of current work in AI is that it is missing this perspective, both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we discuss the promising approach of developmental artificial intelligence, modeling infant development through multi-scale interaction between intrinsically motivated learning, embodiment and a fastly changing socio-cultural environment.

      "Answer: The large distances involved in interstellar travel require a high degree of spacecraft autonomy, realized by artificial intelligence. The breadth of tasks artificial intelligence could perform on such spacecraft involves maintenance, data collection, designing and constructing an infrastructure using in-situ resources. Despite its importance, existing publications on artificial intelligence and interstellar travel are limited to cursory descriptions where little detail is given about the nature of the artificial intelligence. This article explores the role of artificial intelligence for interstellar travel by compiling use cases, exploring capabilities, and proposing typologies, system and mission architectures. Estimations for the required intelligence level for specific types of interstellar probes are given, along with potential system and mission architectures, covering those proposed in the literature but also presenting novel ones. Finally, a generic design for interstellar probes with an AI payload is proposed. Given current levels of increase in computational power, a spacecraft with a similar computational power as the human brain would have a mass from dozens to hundreds of tons in a 2050-2060 timeframe. Given that the advent of the first interstellar missions and artificial general intelligence are estimated to be by the mid-21st century, a more in-depth exploration of the relationship between the two should be attempted, focusing on neglected areas such as protecting the artificial intelligence payload from radiation in interstellar space and the role of artificial intelligence in self-replication.\n",

      "Answer: In 2011, Hibbard suggested an intelligence measure for agents who compete in an adversarial sequence prediction game. We argue that Hibbard's idea should actually be considered as two separate ideas: first, that the intelligence of such agents can be measured based on the growth rates of the runtimes of the competitors that they defeat; and second, one specific (somewhat arbitrary) method for measuring said growth rates. Whereas Hibbard's intelligence measure is based on the latter growth-rate-measuring method, we survey other methods for measuring function growth rates, and exhibit the resulting Hibbard-like intelligence measures and taxonomies. Of particular interest, we obtain intelligence taxonomies based on Big-O and Big-Theta notation systems, which taxonomies are novel in that they challenge conventional notions of what an intelligence measure should look like.

      "Question: What is the research focus of the paper titled 'Cognitive Architecture for Co-Evolutionary Hybrid Intelligence'?\n",
      "Answer: This paper questions the feasibility of a strong (general) data-centric artificial intelligence (AI). The disadvantages of this type of intelligence are discussed. As an alternative, the concept of co-evolutionary hybrid intelligence is proposed. It is based on the cognitive interoperability of man and machine. An analysis of existing approaches to the construction of cognitive architectures is given. An architecture seamlessly incorporates a human into the loop of intelligent problem solving is considered. The article is organized as follows. The first part contains a critique of data-centric intelligent systems. The reasons why it is impossible to create a strong artificial intelligence based on this type of intelligence are indicated. The second part briefly presents the concept of co-evolutionary hybrid intelligence and shows its advantages. The third part gives an overview and analysis of existing cognitive architectures. It is concluded that many do not consider humans part of the intelligent data processing process. The next part discusses the cognitive architecture for co-evolutionary hybrid intelligence, providing integration with humans. It finishes with general conclusions about the feasibility of developing intelligent systems with humans in the problem-solving loop.\n",

      "Question: What is the research focus of the paper titled 'Psychology of Artificial Intelligence: Epistemological Markers of the Cognitive Analysis of Neural Networks'?\n",
      "Answer: What is the \"nature\" of the cognitive processes and contents of an artificial neural network? In other words, how does an artificial intelligence fundamentally \"think,\" and in what form does its knowledge reside? The psychology of artificial intelligence, as predicted by Asimov (1950), aims to study this AI probing and explainability-sensitive matter. This study requires a neuronal level of cognitive granularity, so as not to be limited solely to the secondary macro-cognitive results (such as cognitive and cultural biases) of synthetic neural cognition. A prerequisite for examining the latter is to clarify some epistemological milestones regarding the cognitive status we can attribute to its phenomenology.\n",

      "Question: What is the research focus of the paper titled 'A Definition of Artificial Intelligence'?\n",
      "Answer: In this paper we offer a formal definition of Artificial Intelligence and this directly gives us an algorithm for construction of this object. Really, this algorithm is useless due to the combinatory explosion. The main innovation in our definition is that it does not include the knowledge as a part of the intelligence. So according to our definition a newly born baby also is an Intellect. Here we differs with Turing's definition which suggests that an Intellect is a person with knowledge gained through the years.\n",

In this study, I constructed an artificial intelligence using a genetic algorithm that learns in an artificial market simulation, and investigated whether the artificial intelligence discovers market manipulation through learning with an artificial market simulation despite a builder of artificial intelligence has no intention of market manipulation. As a result, the artificial intelligence discovered market manipulation as an optimal investment strategy. This result suggests necessity of regulation, such as obligating builders of artificial intelligence to prevent artificial intelligence from performing market manipulation.\n",
